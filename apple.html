                <p>Apple aims to be a manufacturer that will one day make products without mining any new material from
                    the earth. To achieve this bold vision, they are constantly inventing more efficient ways to recycle
                    materials back into their devices. Currently, all Apple devices are made from recycled Aluminum,
                    which is a huge move towards being environmentally friendly. They are also replacing fossil fuels
                    with renewable energy. All their facilities worldwide now run on 100% renewable energy. These are
                    their big steps toward a smaller carbon footprint.</p>

            <div id="four">
                <h2>Why Choose Apple Products?</h2>
                <p>Several words come to mind when one thinks of Apple’s products – sleek, intelligent, exclusive, and
                    so on. For Apple, user experience has, and continues to be, of utmost importance. Design-wise, its
                    products are minimalist, yet premium, and they are also known for their vivid displays, powerful
                    cameras, and top-notch performance.

                    Apple is also known for its tight and secure ecosystem of products, which allow you to sync
                    messages, photos, contacts, documents, and just about everything between them. Furthermore, features
                    like AirDrop make it easy to send photos from your iPhone to your Mac, signing documents on your
                    iPad, and more. Other noteworthy features include Sidecar to use an iPad to extend Mac’s screen, and
                    Handoff to seamlessly switch between Apple devices amongst others.

                    Running parallel is Apple’s efforts to ensure it does no harm to our planet. Its devices are being
                    manufactured from recycled aluminium. Its facilities too around the world run on 100% renewable
                    energy.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="five">
                <h2>Is Apple the right choice for you?</h2>
                <p>If you’re a jet setting professional, there’s a high chance that you’re already using one of the
                    latest Apple iPhones. Students, juggling between assignments in college, tend to prefer the
                    versatility of a MacBook. Stay-at-home parents with artistic hobbies tend to lean towards an iPad
                    for their creative pursuits, while fitness enthusiasts find an Apple Watch and AirPods as trusty gym
                    companions.

                    Beyond its core products, Apple’s lineup of accessories is also noteworthy. These include a range of
                    straps for your Watch, cases for your iPhone, sleeves for your MacBook or iPad , and more.

                    If you’re someone who tends to lose things, you may want to check out the AirTags. They can also be
                    used to track down your friends and family, and even help you remember where you parked your car. If
                    you’re not a big fan of laptop keyboards and trackpads, you might want to check out the external
                    keyboard and mouse for the Mac, and Magic Keyboard Folio Case to boost an iPad’s productivity.</p>
